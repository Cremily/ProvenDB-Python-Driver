   ProvenDB

PyProven is a Python module that wraps the original PyMongo driver,
adding all ProvenDB functionality with type-hinting,
ProvenDB-specific data classes and exceptions.
Python developers should feel comfortable making
ProvenDB applications in the same way as they make existing PyMongo applications.
